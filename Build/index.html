                <ul class="features">
                    <li>
                        <h3>Flexible</h3>
                        <!-- TODO: Insert image -->
                        <p>Becaause Ignition doesn't impose its own grid framework on you, you're free to craft the responsive behaviour of your projects however you see fit.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Semantic</h3>
                        <!-- TODO: Insert image -->
                        <p>Because Ignition is a set of SCSS tools as opposed to a CSS grid, your html won't get polluted with lots of presentational class names just to make the grid work.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Streamlined</h3>
                        <!-- TODO: Insert image -->
                        <p>The page you are reading now was created and styled in a few hours using Ignition - It really does <em>vastly</em> reduce the amount of code required to write a responsive site.</p>
                    </li>

                <h2>Frameworks suck</h2>
                <p>Responsive websites are great. CSS frameworks, on the other hand, are not. They impose rigid behaviour, and require you as a developer to pollute your markup with presentational classes, forcing you to break the separation of concerns and semantic accuracy you care about in your development. On the other hand, though, creating a responsive website without some kind of grid system behind it is near impossible. So what to do? Do you accept the rigidity and inherent issues with using a framework like Bootstrap or Foundation? Or do you slog away for hours, painstakingly coding every media query for every element in your project yourself?</p>

                <p>Rather than giving you a complete, ready-to-use grid like the popular CSS frameworks, Ignition gives you the tools you need to craft your own responsive grid as you go along, using the power of SCSS to dramatically reduce the amount of code you have to write to achieve this.</p>
                <p>Ignition also provides you with a comprehensive set of tools for other common, but time-consuming, tasks in CSS including CSS3 helpers for box-shadow, border-radius and gradient properties. </p>
